* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.

* Themes

Various minimalist themes for various apps.


** Terminal

The terminal theme is inspired from [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell][Base16-shell]].

Simply source it in zshrc (or bashrc I guess) to apply color changes.
