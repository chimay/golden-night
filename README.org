* Golden night theme

Minimalist golden night theme for various apps.

It is a brown foreground on a black background, with a few extra
colors for syntax highlighting.

** Terminal

The terminal theme is inspired from [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell][Base16-shell]].

Simply source it in zshrc (or bashrc I guess) to apply color changes.

* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
